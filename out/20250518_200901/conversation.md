6.  **Title:** Size-Controlled Preparation of Microsized Perfluorocarbon Emulsions as Oxygen Carriers via the Shirasu Porous Glass Membrane Emulsification Technique.
    *   **Abstract:** We have developed microsized perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsions with different sizes as artificial oxygen carriers (OCs) via Shirasu porous glass membrane emulsification. Monodispersed PFC emulsions with narrow size distribution were obtained. By changing the membrane pore size, we were able to precisely control the size of emulsions and fabricate emulsions similar in size to human red blood cells. Behaviors of Pluronics with different physiochemical properties (F127, F68, P85, and P103) as surfactants were also investigated, which evidenced that the type and concentration of Pluronics have a major impact on the size of emulsions and the response to different thermal conditions. The F127-stabilized microsized PFC emulsions were stable even during autoclave sterilization. The emulsions were loaded with Ru(ddp)-an oxygen-sensitive probe-on their surfaces to indicate oxygen concentration. Finally, incubations with HeLa cells that show fluorescence in response to hypoxia cultured in 2D and 3D suggested promising potential of our emulsions for OCs.

9.  **Title:** Preparation of Monodisperse Calcium Alginate Micro-/Nanospheres via Shirasu Porous Glass Membrane Emulsification Followed by Classification Using Microfiltration Membranes
    *   **Abstract:** Monodisperse calcium alginate micro-/nanospheres were developed via ionic cross-linking of alginate polymers in water-in-oil emulsion droplets prepared using a direct membrane emulsification technique with Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membranes. By changing the concentration of the alginate polymers in the dispersed phase and the pore size of the membrane, we obtained monodisperse calcium alginate micro-/nanospheres with tunable sizes because each micro-/nanosphere was formed in each droplet. However, the monodispersity decreased when SPG membranes with pores of smaller than 0.5 μm were used because they contained larger microspheres from the coalescence of the emulsion droplets. To remove such larger microspheres for achieving an excellent monodispersity, classification using microfiltration membranes was performed. After serial classifications with membranes of 1.2, 0.8, and 0.45 μm pore sizes, the resulting fraction showed an average diameter of 0.22 μm and CV of 21%, starting from an original with an av...

13. **Title:** Multiphoton Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry for the Analysis of Emulsions Prepared via Shirasu Porous Glass Membrane Emulsification
    *   **Abstract:** Multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MPI-TOFMS) was applied to the measurement of toluene oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions prepared via shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification. In the present study, the relationship between small oil droplets introduced into TOFMS and obtained signals was discussed. In emulsion pore of μ m, the of the peak area for toluene obtained by MPI-TOFMS. In the case of an O/W emulsion prepared by a SPG membrane with a pore size of 3 μ m, oil droplets with a diameter of ca. 12 μ m, in addition to droplets of various sizes, were intermittently introduced. Moreover, a lot of spikes were detected on the time profile of the peak area obtained by MPI-TOFMS. In the case of an O/W emulsion prepared by a SPG membrane with a pore size of 5 μ m, larger droplets and their aggregates were introduced. Intense spikes were detected on the time profile in the early stage of the measurement, but the number and the intensity of spikes decreased with time due to creaming of the sample. In addition, the minimum diameter of a droplet that produces a detectable spike was calculated to be 3.4 μ m in the present study.

    *   **Abstract:** Not available
15. **Title:** Effect of Process Parameters on Formation and Aggregation of Nanoparticles Prepared with a Shirasu Porous Glass Membrane.
    *   **Abstract:** The objectives of this study were to prepare itraconazole (ITZ) nanoparticles using a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane and to characterize the effects of diverse preparation parameters on the physical stability of nanoparticles. SPG membrane technology was used for the antisolvent precipitation method. The preparation of nanoparticles was carried out over a wide range of continuous-phase factors (type of surfactant, surfactant concentration), dispersed-phase factors (solvent type, solvent volume used to dissolve ITZ), and technical factors (pressure, membrane pore size, stirring speed in the continuous phase, temperature). Improved physical stability of nanoparticles was observed when surfactant with a lower molecular weight and higher hydrophilic segment ratio was used. The water miscibility of the solvent also had an effect on the physical stability. N,N-Dimethylacetamide contributed to creating a well-rounded shape and narrow size distribution due to high miscibility. Concentration of the surfactant and solvent volume used for dissolving ITZ were related to instability of nanoparticles, resulting from depletion attraction and Ostwald ripening. In addition to these factors, technical factors changed the environment surrounding ITZ nanoparticles, such as the physicochemical equilibrium between surfactant and ITZ nanoparticles. Therefore, the appropriate continuous-phase factors, dispersed-phase factors, and technical factors should be maintained for stabilizing ITZ nanoparticles.

17. **Title:** Formation and modification of dispersions using Shirasu Porous Glass membranes
    *   **Abstract:** This chapter deals with the production, properties, and macrofluidic applications of Shirasu\nPorous Glass (SPG) membrane. The first section provides an overview of the membrane\nmicrofluidic processes used for production and modification of liquid-liquid and gas-liquid\nmicro- and nano-dispersions, such as direct and premix membrane emulsification with and\nwithout phase inversion, membrane demulsification, membrane micromixing / direct\nprecipitation and micro- and nano-bubbling. In the last section of this chapter, SPG\nmembranes are compared with conventional homogenisers and microfluidic drop generators\nin terms of production rate, droplet size uniformity, and applied shear stresses. The second\nsection deals with the fabrication of SPG membrane by spinodal decomposition in Na2O–\nCaO–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2 type glass and morphological, mechanical, and hydrodynamic\nproperties of SPG membrane. This chapter also covers modification of surface charge, contact\nangle and porosity of SPG membrane using different physical and chemical methods, such as\ndeposition of silica nanoparticles onto membrane surface, coating with silicon resin, filling\nthe pores with solvent-responsive polymer chains and chemical modification with silane\ncoupling agents. The fourth section is focused on the effects of physical properties of the\ndispersed and continuous phase, operating parameters and membrane properties on the droplet\nsize in direct and premix SPG membrane emulsification. In addition, the most common\nclasses of micro- and nano-particles fabricated using SPG membrane were reviewed and their\nfabrication routes were discussed. It was concluded that a broad variety of different chemical\nand physicochemical processes can be combined with SPG membrane emulsification to\nconvert droplets into uniform particle. The last section briefly discusses the generation of\nmicro- and nano-bubbles using SPG membrane.

19. **Title:** Antitumor activity of docetaxel-loaded polymeric nanoparticles fabricated by Shirasu porous glass membrane-emulsification technique
    *   **Abstract:** Docetaxel (DTX) has excellent efficiency against a wide spectrum of cancers. However, the current clinical formulation has limited its usage, as it causes some severe side effects. Various polymeric nanoparticles have thus been developed as alternative formulations of DTX, but they have been mostly fabricated on a laboratory scale. Previously, we synthesized a novel copolymer, poly(lactide)-D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (PLA-TPGS), and found that it exhibited great potential in drug delivery with improved properties. In this study, we applied the Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane-emulsification technique to prepare the DTX-loaded PLA-TPGS nanoparticles on a pilot scale. The effect of several formulation variables on the DTX-loaded nanoparticle properties, including particle size, zeta potential, and drug-encapsulation efficiency, were investigated based on surfactant type and concentration in the aqueous phase, organic/aqueous phase volumetric ratio, membrane-pore size, transmembrane cycles, and operation pressure. The DTX-loaded nanoparticles were obtained with sizes of 306.8 ± 5.5 nm and 334.1 ± 2.7 nm (mean value ± standard deviation), and drug-encapsulation efficiency of 81.8% ± 4.5% and 64.5% ± 2.7% for PLA-TPGS and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, respectively. In vivo pharmacokinetic study exhibited a significant advantage of PLA-TPGS nanoparticles over PLGA nanoparticles and Taxotere. Drug-loaded PLA-TPGS nanoparticles exhibited 1.78-, 6.34- and 3.35-fold higher values for area under the curve, half-life, and mean residence time, respectively, compared with those of PLGA nanoparticles, and 2.23-, 13.2-, 8.51-fold higher than those of Taxotere, respectively. In vivo real-time distribution of nanoparticles was measured on tumor-bearing mice by near-infrared fluorescence imaging, which demonstrated that the PLA-TPGS nanoparticles achieved much higher concentration and longer retention in tumors than PLGA nanoparticles after intravenous injection. This is consistent with the pharmacokinetic behavior of the nanoparticles. The tumor-inhibitory effect of DTX-loaded nanoparticles was observed in vivo in an H22 tumor-bearing mice model via intravenous administration. This indicated that PLA-TPGS nanoparticles are a feasible drug-delivery formulation with a pilot fabrication technique and have superior pharmacokinetic and anticancer effects compared to the commercially available Taxotere.
